# CarND-Controls-PID
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

---

This is the PID control project of self-driving car Term2. 

I implemented PID control algorithm to make the car drive properly in the lane. 

The P/I/D means proportional/derivative/Integral  respectively.

The steering angle is adjusted by:

â€‹	$Steer\ Angle= P*e_{p}+I*e_{I}+D*e_{D}$



## PID Parameter Setting

To selection a proper P/I/D control parameters, I used Twiddle algorithm to optimize these parameters.

At first, I tried the initial PID parameters in {Kp,Ki,Kd} = {0,0,0}, which made car departure from the track easily. 

According to PID control equation, I set smaller value to integral control, lager value to derivative control.

So I manually tuned the initial parameters into {Kp,Ki,Kd} = {0.1, 0.05, 3.0}, and the difference value to adjust the PID control parameters are set to dp[0] = 0.5, dp[1] = 0.01, dp[2] =0.1.

you can find this initialization in main.cpp line 37 `pid.TwiddleInit(0.1, 0.05, 3.0);`

And I set tolorance = 0.01 to be the end criterial to end the twiddle function, which ends as sum (dp) < tolorance.

The hyper-parameters in TwiddleInit, which is in PID.cpp  

```
void PID::TwiddleInit(double Kp, double Ki, double Kd) {
  
  this->Kp = Kp;
  this->Ki = Ki;
  this->Kd = Kd;
  p_error = 0.0;
  i_error = 0.0;
  d_error = 0.0;
  dp[0] = 0.05;
  dp[1] = 0.01;
  dp[2] = 0.1;
  p[0] = Kp;
  p[1] = Ki;
  p[2] = Kd;

  tolorance = 0.01;
  n_step = 100;
  is_twiddle = true;
  iter  = 0;
  best_error = 0.0;
  error = 0.0;
  twiddle_state = IDLE;
  i = 0;


}

```

After PID parameters optimized by Twiddle function, the PID parameters would be set in PID control initialization. These would be main.cpp 37  to  46 line

```
if (!pid.is_twiddle) {

    //PID parameters from twiddlw function
    std::cout << "tiwddle PID:" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Kp = " << pid.Kp << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Ki = " << pid.Ki << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Kd = " << pid.Kd << std::endl;
    pid.Init(pid.Kp, pid.Ki, pid.Kd);
  }

```

In the simulation, the optimization parameters are {Kp,Ki,Kd} = {0.05, 0.061, 3.1} from Twiddle algorithm.
