# CarND-Controls-PID
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

---

This is the PID control project of self-driving car Term2. 

I implemented PID control algorithm to make the car drive properly in the lane. 

The P/I/D means proportional/derivative/Integral  respectively.

The steering angle is adjusted by:

â€‹	$Steer\ Angle= P*e_{p}+I*e_{I}+D*e_{D}$

The P/I/D gain is to adjust proportional/derivative/integral error from the lane center.



## PID Parameter Setting

To selection a proper P/I/D control parameters, I used Twiddle algorithm to optimize these parameters.

According to PID control equation, I set smaller value to integral control, lager value to derivative control.

Here are the parameters I tried:

1. Kp = 0.0, Ki = 0.0, Kd = 0.0

   [video record ](vid/P_0.1_I_0_D_1.mp4)

   I noticed that there was a lot of overshoot situation, so I use Kp = 0.1 as the next parameters.

2. Kp = 0.1, Ki = 0.0, Kd = 0.0

   [video record](vid/P_0.1_I_0_D_0.mp4)

   Kp = 0.1 improved overshoot situation a lot, but the speed to correct car to the track center still too fast. So that I use Kd = 1.0 as the next parameter. The Derivative gain is to control the difference error, so I use lager value to correct that.

3. Kp = 0.1, Ki = 0.0, Kd = 1.0

   [video record](vid/P_0.1_I_0_D_1.mp4)

   In this parameter set, the car still drive with a little bias from the track center. So I added a very small Ki gain to the next parameter, due to the Ki gain is to control the integral error. 

4. Kp = 0.1, Ki = 0.05, Kd = 1.0

   [video record](vid/P_0.1_I_0.05_D1.mp4)

   This parameter set looks good to be the twiddle initial gain set. So I used it to my first gain control parameter.

The initial twiddle gain control parameters is  {Kp,Ki,Kd} = {0.1, 0.05, 1.0}, and the difference value for tuning these gain are dp[0] = 0.01, dp[1] = 0.005, dp[2] =0.1. 

I used 1/10  gain value to adjust the PID control parameters.

you can find this initialization in main.cpp line 52 

```
  Kp = 0.1;
  Ki = 0.05;
  Kd = 1.0;
  pid.TwiddleInit(Kp, Ki, Kd);
```

And a variable tolorance = 0.05 is set to be the  criterial to end the twiddle function, which ends as sum (dp) < tolorance.

The hyper-parameters in TwiddleInit, which is in PID.cpp  

```
void PID::TwiddleInit(double Kp, double Ki, double Kd) {
  
  this->Kp = Kp;
  this->Ki = Ki;
  this->Kd = Kd;
  p_error = 0.0;
  i_error = 0.0;
  d_error = 0.0;
  dp[0] = 0.01;
  dp[1] = 0.005;
  dp[2] = 0.1;
  p[0] = Kp;
  p[1] = Ki;
  p[2] = Kd;

  tolorance = 0.05;
  n_step = 100;
  is_twiddle = true;
  iter  = 0;
  best_error = 0.0;
  error = 0.0;
  twiddle_state = IDLE;
  i = 0;


}
```

After PID parameters optimized by Twiddle function, the PID parameters would be set in PID control initialization. These would be main.cpp 58  to  68 line

The final gain from the twiddle function would be Kp = 0.09, Ki = 0.04, Kd = 1.1. You can find the final parameters with log as program running.

```
  if (!pid.is_twiddle) {

    //PID parameters from twiddlw function
    std::cout << "tiwddle PID:" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Kp = " << pid.Kp << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Ki = " << pid.Ki << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Kd = " << pid.Kd << std::endl;
    //the final gain by twiddle would be:
    // Kp = 0.09, Ki = 0.04, Kd = 1.1
    pid.Init(pid.Kp, pid.Ki, pid.Kd);
  }
```

In the simulation, the optimization parameters are {Kp,Ki,Kd} = {0.05, 0.061, 3.1} from Twiddle algorithm.
